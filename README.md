Overview: The purpose of this project is to prevent athletes from knee injuries caused by incorrect jumping form. According to studies perfermed at UNC, in the USA, there has been a rise in ACL tears in young atheletes, specifically girls aged 13-17, who have endured a 59% increase in ACL reconstruction surgeries from 2004-2017. ACL tears can take months to heal and can lead to long term consequences such as arthrities or osteoarthritis when reaching an older age.

Future Improvements: 
  -test different bamdwidth values to eliminate noise
  -connect Wifi to Nano IoT 33 to allow athletes to see their performance in an app
